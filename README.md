## Overview

This repository contains a collection of my academic projects, showcasing a range of skills and technologies I've learned and applied throughout my studies. Each project highlights different aspects of my academic journey, from foundational concepts to advanced applications.

## Projects List

1. **Eventlog to RDF**
    - **Description**: This project involves converting an Object-Centric Event Log (OCEL) into the Web Ontology Language (OWL). The purpose of this project is to facilitate process mining by leveraging OWL to represent the event log data in a structured and semantically rich format. This conversion allows for more effective querying and analysis of process data.
    - **Technologies Used**: Python, SPARQL, OWLready2, OCEL

2. **News Summarizer**
   - **Description**: The News Summarizer project is designed to automatically generate concise summaries of news articles. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project processes large volumes of text to extract key points, allowing users to quickly understand the gist of the news without reading the full article. 
   - **Technologies Used**: C#, weighted linear regression

3. **Itemset Mining**
   - **Description**: In this project, we extended the SPMF library by implementing new features and enhancing existing algorithms for itemset mining. These enhancements improve the efficiency , enabling more effective pattern discovery in large datasets. The project also involved testing the modified algorithms on various datasets to evaluate their performance.
   - **Technologies Used**: Java, SPMF Library, Data Mining
