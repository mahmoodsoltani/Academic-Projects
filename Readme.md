This project converts an Object-Centric Event Log (OCEL) into a Web Ontology Language (OWL) file using ocel for processing event logs and owlready2 for creating and querying OWL ontologies.

**Features:**

1-  Conversion of OCEL to OWL: Transforms Object-Centric Event Logs into an OWL ontology.

2-  SPARQL Querying: Enables querying of the OWL ontology using SPARQL to extract meaningful insights.

3-  Python Implementation: The project is implemented in Python using the ocel and owlready2 libraries.
